<h1 align="center">Hello! My name is Austin Ginn.</h1>
<p>I am currently the Director of Technology at Alpharetta Methodist. After graduating from Middle Tennessee State University with a Bachelors of Science in Audio Production (Computer Science Minor), I started working at Alpharetta Methodist as Lead A/V Engineer. Three years later I became Director of Technology over seeing all of IT and A/V on campus. I currently lead a team of talented individuals that execute weekly live productions for an online and in person congregation.</p> 
  
<p>My IT and software devolpment foundation began in college, c++ being my lanuage of study.  Since then I have found a passion for web devolpment. I am currently working on and maintaining a number of projects, however my main focus lately has revolved around Blackmagic Design ATEM Switchers. My public projects will be listed below.  If you have an idea or workflow you need improved in this area, I would be happy to work with you to see the project through.</p>
